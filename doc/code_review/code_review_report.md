Code Review - Jiashu: documentation, GroupOrder.js, Login.js, UserProfile.js

Documentation: The documentation is quite clear and concise with what it is expressing, and all the required information to run the app seems to be present. The only thing that might be improved is making it more clear in the README what the environmental variables are, and where exactly to put them. I made a few small changes to better reflect the current state of our app, including restoring the .env.example file, which had been removed previously, and adding the new .env file for the client into the .env section. I also took a look at the API documentation, which seems to be quite spartan, but it conveys the needed information quickly if the user does a ctrl+f to find a specific endpoint or such.

GroupOrder.js: The file itself is quite large, but I am unsure if it can be reduced in size at all: each function relates to the management of a group order, and placing them all in one location allows for certain variables and functions to be reused, avoiding redundant code. This file was actually previously refactored from four files, into one, since the separate portions were so interconnected. In general, it seems to follow our design principles, as well as our general app design. The only thing that might be confusing is the functions that return HTML/React elements. Looking further down the file, this is actually a way to avoid redundant code, as each function is used multiple times. To make these less confusing, I added comments to each of them explaining their use, which would certainly make it easier for future developers. At a quick glance, most of the naming is quite good. The only thing that stumped me was that showModal doesn't explain which modal it displays: however, I later found that this was a way to display multiple types of notification modals using one base function, so there doesn't need to be dozens of modal variables throughout the file, which is a good design choice. Overall, the file would not be difficult to understand for developers, but it might take a minute or two to process where each piece fits in. Each of the functions reflects the simplest way to achieve a certain functionality that we chose in the design, and there is very little, if anything, that is unnecessary or overly complex. I also made sure to remove some comments that would most likely not be followed-up on, just to improve the presentation of the file.

Login.js: The file itself is simple, but still quite compact, and does not take up more space than it needs. In general, it seems to follow our design principles, as well as our general app design. The functions all seem to be highly interconnected in their function, and nothing stands out as unnecessary or overly complex. In fact, each function is simple to understand. The naming conventions are also easily understandable, as they reflect their uses exactly. There are a few comments, which are quite informative, but I added a few for good measure where they might be needed. The file is definitely understandable for any developers looking at it, since this was my first time looking at it, and I understood perfectly what each part means. I also removed some commented out sections of code that were no longer necessary. 

UserProfile.js: Similar to Login, the file is quite simple and compact. In general, it seems to follow our design principles, as well as our general app design. The few functions are basic and understandable. The functions all seem to be highly interconnected in their function, and nothing stands out as unnecessary or overly complex. The naming conventions are also very good for a form, as there are many fields, and some fields that are similar to each other. However, I was able to distinguish each variable/React element and match it with its counterpart in the client. The file is a bit long and has many repeated portions of code to render each input text box, which may be unavoidable due to the nature of having a form with about a dozen unique fields to keep track of. The amount of repetitive code was actually reduced, by using one function to set each useState variable, which was a very smart way of avoiding having a dozen setter functions and variables set up in the same file. The file is very easy to understand, and future developers would not have any difficulty understanding.

Code Review - Zixuan: Dashboard.js, Home.js, OrderListItem.js, ConfirmationListItem.js

Dashboard.js: 1) Design: The code imports and utilizes various libraries and components, which suggests a modular approach. This is good practice in modern JavaScript applications, particularly those using React. 2) Complexity: The initial glimpse shows a standard structure for a React component file with external dependencies, and this is the same as the other code styles in our project. 3) Naming: The names of the imports suggest that they are clearly named and self-explanatory, which is good practice. For instance, OrderListItem and ConfirmationListItem likely represent list items for orders and confirmations, respectively. 4) Comments: The provided snippet doesn't contain any comments. I added some comments to it to make it more understandable. 5) Style: The code follows standard JavaScript and React conventions in the snippet provided, like using camelCase for variable names and importing dependencies at the top of the file, and the rest of the code also follows the same convention. In summary, from the initial look, the code appears well-structured and follows common practices in JavaScript and React development.

Home.js: 1)Design: The use of external libraries like reactstrap suggests an adherence to modern UI design practices, which is a positive sign. The modular import structure is also beneficial for maintainability. 2) Complexity: The initial part of the code is straightforward, focusing on importing necessary modules and assets, which should be relatively easy for other developers to understand. The use of modern React features like hooks is a good sign of keeping up with current best practices. 3) Naming: The naming of imports and assets appears clear and descriptive, which is good for code readability and maintenance. For instance, animation, friends, and shopping likely represent specific images relevant to the component's UI. 4) Comments: The snippet does not include comments, but since the file is pretty simple, the developers should understand easily without having to know extra information. 5) Style: As the same as the Dashboard.js, the code follows standard React and JavaScript practices, which ensures the maintainability. In conclusion, the Home.js file seems well-organized and uses modern React practices with a clear focus on UI layout and design. 

OrderListItem.js: 1) Design: The component structure aligns with React's modular design philosophy. However, its effectiveness in the broader application context (like how it integrates with the order list and user data) needs further examination. 2) Complexity: The initial look suggests a standard complexity level for a React component. Use of hooks (useState, useNavigate) and context (useAuth) are in line with contemporary React practices. The readability would largely depend on the consistency of this approach throughout the component. 4) Naming: The naming, like deadlineDate and OrderListItem, is descriptive, aiding in understanding the component's purpose. 5) Commenting: There's a brief comment at the beginning, which is helpful. However, detailed comments explaining complex logic or specific decisions, I added some more comments for some important parts. 6) Code Style: The snippet follows React and JavaScript best practices in terms of styling and structure. The use of external CSS and structured imports is good. However, consistency across the whole file is key. In conclusion, OrderListItem.js demonstrates a component-centric, modular approach typical in React development, with a focus on user interaction and data presentation. 

ConfirmationListItem.js: This is a simple page and contains fewer functionalities compared to others. It appears to render individual items in a confirmation list, with capabilities to display and format time, handle click events, and visually represent the status of an item. 1) Design: Same as the other files, the structure follows standard React component design, utilizing hooks for state management and reactstrap for UI elements. 2) Naming: Names like convertTime and getStatus are descriptive, aiding in understanding the component's functionality. 3) Comments: The snippet includes minimal comments, but they should be enough for the developers to get familiar with its functionalities. 4) Code Style: The structure adheres to standard React and JavaScript practices. The external CSS import and structured component format are positive signs. In conclusion, ConfirmationListItem.js is a functional component in our project, and it is designed to handle and display confirmation list items in an application.

Code Review - Shichang: OrderItem.css, Admin.js, Checkout.js, CreateGroup.js

OrderItem.css: The code is straightforward and easy to follow. The CSS classes are well-named, indicating their function. CSS and HTML typically don't have automated tests like backend code. Regarding naming, class names like .menu-button, .order-box are clear and descriptive. There are no comments , but CSS and HTML are often self-explanatory. The code follows common CSS practices, with consistent indentation and spacing. Jiashu is the main coder for this file.

Admin.js: The structure of your Admin component demonstrates a clear and logical layout, integrating a sidebar, navbar, and footer which indicates thoughtful design. However, there's a potential for further improvement in the component's architecture. The Admin component appears to handle multiple responsibilities, including layout management, scroll effect logic, and route handling. This multi-faceted approach might lead to challenges in scalability and maintainability. It could be beneficial to break down the Admin component into smaller, more focused components, enhancing readability and reusability fi the project grows larger. While the naming convention used in the code is consistent and clear, some variable names, such as ps, lack descriptiveness. More expressive names would enhance the code's readability and maintainability. Additionally, the code would benefit from comments, especially in complex sections. Descriptive comments would provide valuable context and make the code more accessible to other developers, particularly in explaining the logic behind the scroll effect and route handling. In all, the Admin component is well-constructed with a clear layout and logical integration of various elements. Yuhan was the main coder for this file.

Checkout.js: The Checkout component effectively utilizes React hooks for managing state and side effects, which aligns well with modern React practices. The data fetching within useEffect is appropriately placed for component mounting, but maybe we should add some error handling for a better user experience. It is a large file with many lines of code with many inline styling. Managing these through React's state or CSS classes would be more appropriate and maintainable. The current state of the code lacks comments, which are vital for explaining complex logic and ensuring that the codebase is understandable to other developers or for future reference. Ethan was the main coder for this file.

CreateGroup.js: The component is structured clearly, with a logical flow that is easy to follow. The use of a modal for feedback is a good user experience practice. The use of Reactstrap for UI components ensures a consistent and clean user interface. The current implementation seems efficient for the component's purpose. However, if the form or component complexity increases, consider using the useCallback hook to memoize event handlers, especially in cases where they depend on the component's state. Basic error handling is implemented. Adding descriptive comments, especially for complex logic, would enhance the understandability of the code for other developers or for future reference. Yu-Chun was the main coder for this file.

Code Review - Yiran: Index.js, OrderController.js, ShipperMain.js, Register.js, Map.js, shipper/Dashboard.js

Index.js: The code is well-structured for React applicataion, using the React Router for navigation and context providers for state management. But we could consider separating the routing logic into a dedicated component to declutter Index.js and enhance readability. The code is quite straightforward, defining routes and wrapping the application in necessary context providers. There's no indication of tests in this snippet. The naming of components and imports is clear and follows common conventions. Generally, The main areas for improvement are in testing, documentation, and potentially refactoring for better import management and separation of concerns. The use of context providers and routing is well done.

OrderController.js: The use of a class to encapsulate the order-related actions is a good approach, maintaining a clear structure and separation of concerns. It might be beneficial to abstract the error handling and response formatting into separate middleware or utility functions to reduce repetition and improve maintainability. The methods are straightforward and perform clear, singular tasks. There's repeated code in error handling and status checks. This can be simplified by creating utility functions or middleware for common tasks like error handling or user authorization checks. Names for methods and variables are clear and descriptive.

ShipperMain.js: The component is structured well, using hooks for state management and effect for data fetching. The use of Reactstrap components ensures a consistent UI design. The component is relatively simple and straightforward, focusing solely on displaying data in a table. The naming for variables and functions is clear and descriptive. I think the main areas for improvement are in maintaining consistent code styling, enhancing test coverage, and possibly abstracting the data fetching to a separate utility or custom hook for better code organization.

Register.js: The component is well-structured, utilizing React hooks for state management and handling user registration. Maybe if breaking down the form into smaller components or custom hooks to handle form state and validation, which can improve readability and reusability. The component is relatively straightforward but contains several responsibilities (form handling, validation, modal management). The naming of states and functions is clear and descriptive. There's no indication of tests in this snippet, the code follows React and JavaScript practices. The main areas for improvement could in code organization.

Map.js: I think the separation of the Map and MapWrapper components is a good practice. It keeps the map logic encapsulated and makes Map cleaner.The implementation is straightforward, focusing solely on displaying a Map with custom styles and a marker. But the code lacks comments, which would be especially helpful in explaining the Maps integration and configuration. At least when I implemented my task, this file is irrelevant, and it could be better for the main coder to point out its usage (wherther or not this file is just contained in the framework). 

shipper/Dashboard.js: The component handles state and UI rendering in a straightforward manner. The use of .filter() for different order types is efficient. To reduce complexity, especially if more functionalities are added in the future, abstracting the filtering logic and UI rendering into separate functions or custom hooks could be beneficial. This component is functionally comprehensive and well-implemented for its current functionality. The main areas for improvement are in code organization (breaking down into smaller components), enhancing test coverage, and maintaining consistent code styling. Generally I was able to easily add my new features in UI for shipper to check the group order's detail and change the status, and it will also reflect on the update on the table in the dashboard. By modifying the filters to ket it display the group orders with different status changed by shipper.The handler and corresponding consts are well separated. In the return block, I understand the structure of the tables and I'm able to create more tables to show the orders in different status.
